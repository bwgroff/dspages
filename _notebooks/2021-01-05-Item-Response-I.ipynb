    "Item response models are used to simultaneously make inferences about two interacting populations. Commonly, a population of test questions and a population of test takers (students) with the result (success/failure) of each student on each question they've seen. This is an interesting problem in that even in the basic case:\n",
    "\n",
    "- students have different levels of competence\n",
    "- questions have different levels of difficulty\n",
    "- not every student sees every question\n",
    "- not every question needs to be seen by the same number of students\n",
    "- we should be able to make relative inferences between students/questions that have no overlapping questions/students\n",
    "- the data is nonetheless fairly simple: `[correct (Boolean), student_id (categorical), question_id (categorical]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Item Response is very similar to collaborative filtering, albeit typically a different approach and different intent. Collaborative filtering is often done at scale using [alternating least squares (ALS) e.g. in Spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.2.0/ml-collaborative-filtering.html). \n",
