# Hi!

I'm [Brad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brad-groff/) and I'm using this space to share some of my experiments in [Julia](https://julialang.org/).

Things I'll probably be taking a peek at:

- Turing.jl and Bayesian inference
- Machine learning
- Deep learning
- Data visualization
- Reinforcement learning

Note that this site is built with [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), which is :fire:.
