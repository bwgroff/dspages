# Hi!

I'm [Brad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brad-groff/) and I'm using this space to share some of my experiments in [Julia](https://julialang.org/), which looks pretty rad for data science.

Things I might be taking a peek at:

- Turing.jl and Bayesian inference
- Machine learning
- Deep learning
- Data visualization
- Reinforcement learning

Note that this site is built with [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), which is pure :fire:.

Also, check out a similar site by my brilliant cousin [Michael Harding](https://moh1333.github.io/blog/)! This dude is :bulb:!
