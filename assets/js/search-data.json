            "content": "using Turing using Gadfly using DataFrames, DataFramesMeta Gadfly.set_default_plot_size(900px, 300px) . . Customer Lifetime Value (LTV or CLTV) is the total dollar value a consumer will spend at a business throughout their life. The concept is as important as the definition is straightforward - businesses very often want to know which consumers are their whales and which are eating up their marketing or infrastructure budgets with little or no value returned. This is pretty tricky and there are a few approaches you can take: . Observational . Naive calculation. The following will give you an average that is delightfully simple but tragically wrong: . $$ mathrm{LTV} = frac{1}{| mathrm{Customers}|} sum_{ mathrm{orders}} mathrm{Order Value}$$ . Assuming (hmm) that LTV is constant over time, this will converge to the true average LTV value as customers churn (and thus achieve their final lifetime value). New customers will continue to weigh the average down and make it an underestimate. There are some of these sort of equations floating around the tubes. . Wait and see. Simialr algorithm to the above, the major difference is applying this to only a small cohort from a brief window in time. Just follow along with that group and add up how much they spend. This is simple and will get to the true LTV of that cohort faster but it&#39;s still typically too slow to be useful. By the time you know, it&#39;s months/quarters/years later (depending on the churn characteristics of your product) and most insights you might glean are no longer relevant to your product roadmap. . Modeled . Machine Learning :tada:. There are a bunch of ML approaches here that can be found relatively easily online (but apparently not easy enough for me to find them again to include here). IIRC, one was using a random forest (or GBM, or whatever) to predict . $$P( mathrm{purchase in next period}| mathcal{D})$$ . and then in a second stage model (conditioned on the purchase outcome) predict the order value of said purchase. . It&#39;s a reasonably standard approach: decompose the problem into churn, expected future purchases, and expected value per purchase. There are a bunch of approaches that are tailored to this decomposition by breaking down the inputs into the so called RFM metrics: . Recency: time since the last purchase, | Frequency: number of purchases per time period, | Monetary value: average order value. | . Note that we&#39;ll use days for the time scale. . Buy &#39;til You Die. This type of model was popularized by Schmittlein, David C., Donald G. Morrison, and Richard Colombo in 1987 but was apparently not very easy to implement. A simpler version was created by Fader, Hardie and Lee and Fader at least built a company that expanded quite a bit on these sorts of models, Zodiac. . Custom Model. That&#39;s what we&#39;re going to do! Fader and Hardie do a great job of making their work look harder than necessary so I can&#39;t be bothered to decode it (and anyway, Alex did a great job). That said, I&#39;m going to take what seems to be a similar approach and takes advantage of some more modern techniques (Julia and Turing.jl!): . Estimate churn based on Recency and Frequency. | Set up a super simple survival model to understand the expected number of future purchases using sample from (1) as the churn signal. | Scale by Monetary value. | By building these out independently we can understood the whole model but first figuring it out component-by-component. It also provides a quick way to make single-component adjustments that might be important. There will be many, the model has some real obvious deficiencies even though it captures the right ideas. . For instance, some retailers have an extremely wide spread of possible order values (e.g. Walmart, you can buy a stick of gum or probably a boat or something). If there are orders-of-magnitude differences in purchase value then you better model that out so you know exactly which consumers are likely to find themselves in that lucrative long tail. In my experience, lognormal is a decent start but the tail is still too light. . Our Models . Active from RF . We sample when we expect the customer&#39;s next purchase to occur based on what we&#39;ve observed of their frequency, then we compare that to how long it&#39;s been since they purchased. If we expected them to have purchased already but they haven&#39;t then we count them as churned. . $$ begin{aligned} mathrm{next purchase} &amp; sim mathrm{Exponential}(F) mathrm{active} &amp;= R &lt; mathrm{next purchase} end{aligned} $$Note that we don&#39;t have any kind of regularization and just assume F is a fine number for us. Exercise for the reader to make that more stable :smile:. . Future Purchases from RF+Active . We&#39;d like to then take the inferences above and use them to understand churn as a function of time, or perhaps number of orders. In other words: . $$P( mathrm{churned}_{t=i} | mathrm{active}_{t=i-1})$$ . Here we find some wrinkles. Most notably, what to do with consumers that have recently purchased and we don&#39;t know if they are going to churn before the next purchase? This is called censoring, which comes in many directional varieties and this variety is called right-censoring (on the &quot;right&quot; side of our time interval, we don&#39;t yet have data on the outcome). We&#39;ll ignore that for now, and instead assume &quot;constant hazard&quot; on the data we can observe, ie the rate at which users remain active ($ rho$) is constant across all time points. . $$ begin{aligned} rho &amp; sim mathrm{Beta}(1,1) mathrm{purchases}_{uncensored} &amp; sim mathrm{Geometric( rho)} ( mathrm{Future purchases}) &amp; sim begin{cases} mathrm{Geometric}( rho) &amp; mathrm{if active} mathrm{Dirac}(0) &amp; mathrm{otherwise} end{cases} end{aligned} $$LTV from M+Future Purchases . $$ begin{aligned} mathrm{Future value} &amp;= mathrm{Future purchases} * mathrm{AOV} mathrm{Lifetime value} &amp;= mathrm{Future value} + mathrm{Past value} end{aligned} $$ The estimator of the survival function $S(t)$ (the probability that life is longer than $t$) is given by: . $$ widehat {S}(t)= prod limits _{i: t_{i} leq t} left(1-{ frac {d_{i}}{n_{i}}} right)$$ . with $t_{i}$ a time when at least one event happened, $d_i$ the number of events (e.g., deaths) that happened at time $t_{i}$, and $n_{i}$ the individuals known to have survived (have not yet had an event or been censored) up to time $t_{i}$. .

            "content": "To get myself comfortable with Julia and Turing.jl, I wrote out a bunch of toy models on the simplest of datasets: a vector of binary outcomes. To keep myself honest and to have something to refer to, I&#39;m reproducing them here. . using Turing using Bijectors using Gadfly using DataFrames, DataFramesMeta Gadfly.set_default_plot_size(900px, 300px) . . Standard Biased Coin Estimation . Coinflipping is a time-honored introductory example for probability, and for good reason. Readily interpretable, amenable to both analytical solutions and manual calculation. Nevermind that &quot;unfair&quot; coins are essentially impossible to make... . We&#39;ll build two models that are essentially the same but have distinct computational profiles. Bernoulli: . $$ begin{aligned} beta &amp; sim mathrm{Beta}(1,1) y_i &amp; sim mathrm{Bernoulli}( beta) end{aligned}$$And Binomial: . $$ begin{aligned} beta &amp; sim mathrm{Beta}(1,1) mathrm{sum}(y) &amp; sim mathrm{Binomial}( mathrm{length}(y), beta) end{aligned}$$ Bernoulli Model . First thing to do is to translate the Bernoulli code above into a @model in Turing (docs): . @model function coinflip_bernoulli(y) # prior on p p ~ Beta(1, 1) # updates on p for i in 1:length(y) y[i] ~ Bernoulli(p) end end; . It looks more or less like the description above, with the loop for i in 1:length(y) serving the same purpose as the subscript of $y_i$. . data = [1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0] &quot;There are $(sum(data)) positive results out of $(length(data)) samples, for a positive rate of $(sum(data) / length(data)).&quot; . &#34;There are 11 positive results out of 24 samples, for a positive rate of 0.4583333333333333.&#34; .

Binomial Model . Now let&#39;s take a look at the equivalent model using a Binomial distribution that expresses the exact same underlying phenomena.

Other Parameter Spaces . Going further afield, we can also model $ beta$ on an unconstrained scale ($ mathbb{R}$ instead of the unit interval $[0,1]$) by linking the domains with $ mathrm{logit}^{-1}$: . $$ begin{aligned} mathrm{logit}^{-1}&amp;: mathbb{R} to (0, 1) mathrm{logit}^{-1}(x) &amp;= frac{e^x}{e^x + 1} end{aligned}$$Under this transformation, we don&#39;t have to worry about ensuring our parameters stay in the range of $(0,1)$ - check out $ rho$ here: . $$ begin{aligned} rho &amp; sim mathrm{Normal}(0, 5) beta &amp;= mathrm{logit}^{-1}( rho) y_i &amp; sim mathrm{Bernoulli}( beta) end{aligned}$$On it&#39;s own, this seems like a frivolous transformation but it allows us to incorporate multiple signals into our determination of the probability of a positive result. Turns out, this is just logistic regression. Imagine we have one outcome $y$ that depends on several inputs $x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n$: . $$ begin{aligned} rho_i &amp; sim mathrm{Normal}(0,5) beta &amp;= mathrm{logit}^{-1}( rho_1 x_1 + rho_2 x_2 + ldots + rho_n x_n) y_i &amp; sim mathrm{Bernoulli}( beta) end{aligned}$$Because we pass the regression product through $ mathrm{logit}^{-1}$, we know the value of $ beta$ will be between 0 and 1. If we didn&#39;t apply this transformation then adding up the components of $ beta$ could lead to values outside of that range, (and therefore not in the support of the Bernoulli distribution) which would cause the computation to fail. . The same approach works for the Binomial model: . $$ begin{aligned} rho_i &amp; sim mathrm{Normal}(0,5) beta &amp;= mathrm{logit}^{-1}( rho_1 x_1 + rho_2 x_2 + ldots + rho_n x_n) mathrm{sum}(y) &amp; sim mathrm{Binomial}( mathrm{length}(y), beta) end{aligned}$$ Logit calculations . Turing allows us to create a logit function in two ways. One is in pure Julia code (note I didn&#39;t apply a type assertion to the x argument: things can get messy here with automatic differentiation): . function invlogit(x) ex = exp(x) return ex / (1 + ex) end; . It&#39;s also possible to use the same transformations that Turing uses internally from the Bijectors.jl library. Some sampling algorithms like HMC require an unbounded sampling space to (at least up to Float64 constraints...). To support that on bounded domains, the Bijectors library creates functions that map (smoothly) between continuous spaces (Bijectors README). . logit = bijector(Beta()) # bijection: (0, 1) → ℝ inv_logit = inv(logit) # bijection: ℝ → (0, 1) @model function coinflip_invlogit(heads::Int64, flips::Int64) # prior on p logit_p ~ Normal(0, 5) # or any unbounded distribution # update on p heads ~ Binomial(flips, invlogit(logit_p)) end; . &quot;Our favorite value: $(logit(0.458)).&quot; . &#34;Our favorite value: -0.16839681732546127.&#34; . heads = sum(data) flips = length(data) chain_invlogit = sample( coinflip_invlogit(heads, flips), HMC(ϵ, τ), iterations, progress=false, drop_warmup=true); plot(DataFrame(chain_invlogit), x=:logit_p, xintercept=[-0.168], Theme(alphas=[0.6]), Stat.density(bandwidth=0.05), Geom.polygon(fill=true, preserve_order=true), Geom.vline, Coord.cartesian(ymin=0.0), Guide.yticks(label = false) ) . . logit_p -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 -6.0 -5.8 -5.6 -5.4 -5.2 -5.0 -4.8 -4.6 -4.4 -4.2 -4.0 -3.8 -3.6 -3.4 -3.2 -3.0 -2.8 -2.6 -2.4 -2.2 -2.0 -1.8 -1.6 -1.4 -1.2 -1.0 -0.8 -0.6 -0.4 -0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3.0 3.2 3.4 3.6 3.8 4.0 4.2 4.4 4.6 4.8 5.0 5.2 5.4 5.6 5.8 6.0 -6 -3 0 3 6 -6.0 -5.5 -5.0 -4.5 -4.0 -3.5 -3.0 -2.5 -2.0 -1.5 -1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 5.5 6.0 h,j,k,l,arrows,drag to pan i,o,+,-,scroll,shift-drag to zoom r,dbl-click to reset c for coordinates ? for help ? Note the new x-axis which is the transformation of the previous axis.

Despite describing essentially the same model, performance will differ significantly beteen the Binomial and the Bernoulli cases especially as the volume of data increases. The log-likelihood calculations in each sample loop are $O(1)$ versus $O( mathrm{rows})$, respectively. Here&#39;s a comparison with a modestly larger dataset: . long_data = repeat(data, 10); @time sample( coinflip(long_data), HMC(ϵ, τ), iterations, progress=false); . 3.516949 seconds (32.01 M allocations: 989.621 MiB, 7.51% gc time) . heads = sum(long_data) flips = length(long_data) @time sample( coinflip_binomial(heads, flips), HMC(ϵ, τ), iterations, progress=false); . 0.039479 seconds (329.91 k allocations: 23.239 MiB) . Caution! . Just a little &quot;gotcha&quot; I ran into. The following model won&#39;t work, due to design choices in Turing: . @model function coinflip_BROKEN_THIS_WONT_WORK_AAAAAGH(y::Array{Int64}) # prior on p p ~ Beta(1, 1) # updates on p # these lines are the problem. heads = sum(y) # heads is not RV or argument heads ~ Binomial(length(y), p) # so it can&#39;t be on LHS of ~ end; . The reason is that Turing assumes that all variables on the left hand side of ~ are either . random variables (generated by Turing) or | declared as inputs to the function | By way of analogy to Stan, the @model block of Turing is only intended to represent the parameter, tranformed parameter and model blocks of Stan. As Turing is just Julia code, this is little inconvenience (just do the data transformations in Julia first, it&#39;s more efficient anyway!) but it can be a bit of a surprise and the error message is difficult to interpret. . Incorporating Prior Knowledge . The above models depend on unexplained constants in the Beta distribution ($ mathrm{Beta}(1,1)$ vs, say, $ mathrm{Beta}(13.859, pi^e)$). Those choices were left unjustified and unexplained and here we&#39;ll put some more thought into them. . Let&#39;s assume you are passingly familiar with the concept of flipping coins. Consequently you reasonably expect nearly every coin to be fair and nearly every person you know to not be Persi Diaconis. Personally, I&#39;d need to see a lot of data to accept that a coin had a substantial bias, so in this section we explore how to bake that belief intentionally into our model as a prior distribution (the parameters of Beta, in this case). This is a small change to the model but we&#39;ll explore the impacts of a few alternatives: . $$ begin{aligned} beta &amp; sim mathrm{Beta}(1,1) &amp; mathrm{ versus} beta &amp; sim mathrm{Beta}(5,5) &amp; mathrm{ versus} beta &amp; sim mathrm{Beta}(50,50) &amp; mathrm{ versus} beta &amp; sim mathrm{Beta}(15,5)&amp; mathrm{ (for fun)} end{aligned}$$ In this particular case, the $ mathrm{Beta}$ distribution is what&#39;s known as a conjugate prior for both the Bernoulli and Binomial distributions. That means we can interpret the prior as essentially just bringing more data to do table. For example, we can think of $ mathrm{Beta}(5,5)$ as showing up and pretending we&#39;d already observed $4 = 5-1$ heads and $4=5-1$ tails ahead of time. Similarly, $ mathrm{Beta}(15,5)$ is like baking in knowledge about $14 = 15-1$ heads and $4=5-1$ tails outside of the observed data. The &quot;subtract 1&quot; business is just part of the $ mathrm{Beta}$ distribution details. . x = .001:0.001:.999 Θ = [(1,1), (5,5), (50,50), (15,5)] distributions = [ DataFrame( x=x, ymax=pdf.(Beta(θ[1], θ[2]), x), ymin=0.0, θ=&quot;$θ&quot;) for θ in Θ] plot(vcat(distributions...), x=:x, y=:ymax, ymin=:ymin, ymax=:ymax, color=:θ, Geom.line, Geom.ribbon, Theme(alphas=[0.6]), Guide.ylabel(nothing), Guide.yticks(label=false), Guide.title(&quot;Prior Distributions&quot;), Coord.cartesian(xmin=0.0, xmax=1.0, ymin=0.0) ) . x -1.5 -1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 -1.00 -0.95 -0.90 -0.85 -0.80 -0.75 -0.70 -0.65 -0.60 -0.55 -0.50 -0.45 -0.40 -0.35 -0.30 -0.25 -0.20 -0.15 -0.10 -0.05 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50 0.55 0.60 0.65 0.70 0.75 0.80 0.85 0.90 0.95 1.00 1.05 1.10 1.15 1.20 1.25 1.30 1.35 1.40 1.45 1.50 1.55 1.60 1.65 1.70 1.75 1.80 1.85 1.90 1.95 2.00 -1 0 1 2 -1.0 -0.9 -0.8 -0.7 -0.6 -0.5 -0.4 -0.3 -0.2 -0.1 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.0 (1, 1) (5, 5) (50, 50) (15, 5) θ h,j,k,l,arrows,drag to pan i,o,+,-,scroll,shift-drag to zoom r,dbl-click to reset c for coordinates ? for help ?

Analytical Posterior Distributions You can see how it lines up with the samples from the posterior via HMC. The fun of something like Turing is that you don&#39;t always have access to simple conjugate priors for your distribution, but you can still do all the same fancy stuff even without pure analytic solutions! .",
